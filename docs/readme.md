## Alternatives

- [AWS's DynamoDB DocumentClient](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/DynamoDB/DocumentClient.html) is a decent alternative, although it doesn't handle any validation (schema or any kind).
- [dynamoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamoose) is another modelling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB (inspired by [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com)).

## Development

- Documentation is stored in Git, alongside code, therefore as code changes so should the documentation!
- This also means that documentation for older tags/versions is available at all times, and will be linked [from the repo's README](../README.md).
